    <h2>Origins of Paper stars </h2>
    <p> Paper stars(aka Lucky Stars) are originally from Japan. Back in the  The story of paper stars starts with a girl named Hoshi. She was in love with the stars, made sure to look at them every night before she went to sleep. One night, the stars began to fall. To preserve the ones that fell, she made a lucky star for each and kept them in a jar.  </p>

      <h2> How to Make </h2>
  <ol> 
    <li> Make sure you get long stripes of paper</li>
    <li> At one end tie it into a knott (not too tight or too loose)</li>
    <li> Then wrap the remainder of the paper over the flat sides of the star until it looks like a pentagon</li>
    <li> At the end of the paper, you will tuck it into the flaps of the pentagon </li>
    <li> Once you have a pentagon, pinch at each point untill it puffs up</li>
    <li> If it caves in, you either wrapped the excess around the star too tight or too loose</li>
